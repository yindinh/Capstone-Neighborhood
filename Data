Data:

In this project, I used the the Foursquare location data to find the schools and playgrounds within a given radius of the city, San Jose. I then used k-means clustering to get clusters of the centers of the schools and playgrounds. I used a GET request URL and a function to search using category id in the  Foursquare API. I visualized the resulting centers using folium to render center points on the map.
